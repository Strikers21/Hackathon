</font></h2></head>
<body><p><font size="5">It is first time that MoS (Minister of State) has been given the responsibility of developing entrepreneurship in the country, though this task has been undertaken previously by multiple departments and agencies. UPA government witnessed entrepreneurship skill development with the departments of MSME (Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises), NDA is doing under the scope of National Skill Development Agency.

<body><p><font size="5">Introducing a federal ministry for entrepreneurship and skill development shows that Mr. Modi is serious about developing and promoting entrepreneurial startups in contemporary times of advancing economies. By 2022, India have targeted to obtain skill development for about 500 million people, primarily through encouraging private players to provide viability gap funding and skill development programme initiatives. With this target in mind, and with the help of private players, it is ministries role to enforce targets are achieved and also create an ecosystem that ensures ease of doing business and nurtures entrepreneurship by eliminating bottlenecks during the process.

<head><h2><font color="red">10,000 crore fund for venture capital in MSME sector
</font></h2></head>
<body><p><font size="5">10,000 crore initiative is to accelerate investment from private firms to startups in the name of “equity, quasi equity, soft loans and other risk capital” to create a suitable environment for venture capital in MSME sector. In countries like US, Israel, and Singapore, public funding prevails to be the main source of funding in growing ecosystems of startups. We believe that the present government would take lessons from such countries, and such a fund guides risk capital towards areas where it is required the most, yet mostly deficient: research, technology commercialization, product development, etc.
